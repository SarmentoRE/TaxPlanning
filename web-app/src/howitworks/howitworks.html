<h1 class="heading"><b>How it Works</b></h1>
<p class="text">
Everyone deserves and needs a plan for retirement. We want to help you make one in advance so that you can retire worry-free, knowing that you'll have the money you want. We want to be as transparent as possible with how we're telling you to spend your money, so here's an overview of everything we do with it. We do not permanently store any of your information &mdash; as soon as you leave our page, it's all gone.

<h3 id="inputs" class="heading">What We Ask For</h3>
<h4 class="heading">Your filing status</h4>
<p class="text">We ask you for your IRS filing status so that we can calculate taxes on your investments. Your filing status affects your income bracket, your standard deduction, and various tax credits.</p>

<h4 class="heading">Your income</h4>
<p class="text">We ask you for your current income so we can calculate taxes on your investments. We assume that this will stay constant until your retirement. After retirement, we assume that your brokerage holdings and retirement accounts will be your only source of income.</p>

<h4 class="heading">Ages of your children</h4>
<p class="text">We ask you how many children under the age of 17 you have that qualify for the child tax credit. The child tax credit is potentially a large tax credit that can have a significant impact on the tax rate for your retirement accounts. We need their ages in order to calculate when you will no longer be qualified for each's credit.</p>

<h4 class="heading">How much you can contribute</h4>
<p class="text">We ask you for your current income so we can calculate taxes on your investments. We assume that this will stay constant until your retirement. After retirement, we assume that your brokerage holdings and retirement accounts will be your only source of income.</p>

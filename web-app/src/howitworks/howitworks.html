<p class="text">
Everyone deserves and needs a plan for retirement. We want to help you make one in advance so that you can retire worry-free, knowing that you'll have the money you want. We want to be as transparent as possible with how we're telling you to spend your money, so here's an overview of everything we do with it. We do not permanently store any of your information &mdash; as soon as you leave our page, it's all gone.

<h3 class="heading">What we ask for</h3>
<h4 class="heading">Your filing status</h4>
<p class="text">We ask you for your IRS filing status so that we can calculate taxes on your investments. Your filing status affects your income bracket, your standard deduction, and various tax credits.</p>

<h4 class="heading">Your income</h4>
<p class="text">We ask you for your current income so we can calculate taxes on your investments. We assume that this will stay constant until your retirement. After retirement, we assume that your brokerage holdings and retirement accounts will be your only source of income. If you plan to file your taxes jointly, we ask that you provide your joint income.</p>

<h4 class="heading">Ages of your children</h4>
<p class="text">We ask you how many children under the age of 17 you have that qualify for the child tax credit. The child tax credit is potentially a large tax credit that can have a significant impact on the tax rate for your retirement accounts. We need their ages in order to calculate when you will no longer be qualified for each's credit.</p>

<h4 class="heading">How much you can contribute</h4>
<p class="text">We ask how much income per year that you are able to contribute to your retirement savings. This well help us determine which assets to allocate your retirement savings into and to predict the earnings these assets will accumulate over time.</p>

<h4 class="heading">Your existing assets</h4>
<p class="text">We ask you for any assets you may already have that you could liquidate during your retirement. If you already have $50,000 in a 401k, for example, we can advise that you should probably continue to contribute to that, rather than start over with an empty Roth 401k. If you enter a 401k, we will also take into account any employer matching that your company offers.</p>

<h3 id="inputs" class="heading">How we get our numbers</h3>
<h4 class="heading">How we calculate taxes</h4>
<p class="text">We estimate your income tax at various points in your life based on your filing status, income, children, and anticipated retirement income. We use the 2018 tax brackets and rules to help determine the tax liability of your retirement investments. This is not a fully-featured tax calculator &mdash; tax rates shown are only estimates and may not reflect actual tax rates.</p>

<h4 class="heading">How we calculate yearly amounts</h4>
<p class="text">We estimate yearly amounts with the assumption that your income and your total yearly retirement contribution remain constant until you retire, and that after you retire your withdrawals will be the same each year.</p>

<h4 class="heading">How we allocate your contributions</h4>
<p class="text">401ks, with the highest contribution limits, can usually grow the most during the pre-retirement period. 401k accounts often contain employer matching plans, which is essentially free money contributed towards your 401k account. Brokerage accounts are taxed on dividends, so over longer periods they grow more slowly than any retirement account. We advise that you first place as much as possible in a 401k (either Roth or traditional based on tax advantanges). Then fill a traditional or Roth IRA, and finally, put any leftovers into brokerage accounts. In some situations, this may not be the best strategy &mdash; this is something you should discuss with your financial advisor.</p>

<div class="col-md">
<h3 id="inputs" class="heading">What we give you</h3>
<h4 class="heading">Our pages</h4>
<p class="text">Based on the data you provide us, we recommend either a traditional 401k or a Roth 401k and either a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA. The combination we recommend will maximize your after-tax retirement income.</p>

<h4 class="heading">Our data</h4>
<p class="text">Total cash out displays the sum of all of your expected withdrawals (after taxes), and net cash out displays total cash out minus the sum of all of your additions &mdash; essentially, the money you made from interest.</p>
